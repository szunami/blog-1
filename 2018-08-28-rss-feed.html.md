# Introduction

The first social media timeline was driven not by a siloed push service like
Facebook (2005) or Twitter (2006), but by each individual reader pulling from
websites they liked. Websites that provided rolling content published manifest
files that machines could track and read, and the most well-known such manifest
was [RSS].

I have had this blog for two years, and at first I didn’t bother setting up an
RSS feed because I didn’t have any posts, and then I didn’t bother because I
didn’t have an audience, and now I have an opus and an audience and figured it
was time.

I build this website with [Middleman] and Middleman does not have built-in
support for producing an RSS manifest. It doesn’t, technically, even have
support for blogging; the blog engine is an extension that got adopted by the
main application but is still very much separate from it. Middleman is first
and foremost a website compiler, not a blog engine.

So rather than take the time to learn the Middleman APIs and write an extension
in Ruby that complements the blog engine, I opted to do things the ugly way. I
<del>Googled</del> <ins>DuckDuckWent</ins> for the RSS XML spec, found a bunch
of useless websites and finally gave in and opened the W3Schools[^1] page.

RSS is pretty simple XML. There aren’t that many fields, and what fields there
are, are reasonably[^2] simple to fill out. And thankfully for me, all the
information I needed was available programmatically, ready for me to pull from
Middleman’s Ruby API at compile time.

# The RSS Format

The bare minimum RSS file looks like this:

```xml
<? xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
      <title>My Blog</title>
      <link>https://example.com/</link>
      <description>My very cool blog</description>

      <item>
        <title>My First Post</title>
        <link>https://example.com/my-first-post</link>
        <description>My very first post on my very cool blog</description>
      </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

That’s it. It’s verbose, yes, because XML is a *bad* format, but you only need
six tags to make a valid file, and only three of those hold real information.
Let’s walk through them.

```xml
<? xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
```

This is just bookkeeping to tell the XML parser what is going on. You’d better
be serving all your content in UTF-8, for reasons I don’t need to delve here.
Just, c’mon. It’s `DateTime.now.year`. Use UTF-8.

```xml
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <!-- all your content -->
  </channel>
</rss>
```

These two tags set up an RSS feed. You can only have one `<channel>` in an
`<rss>` and only one `<rss>` in a file, so, I don’t know why we have both of
those tags when the only information they provide is which version of the RSS
spec we’re using, but, whatever.

Those tags describe the entire feed.

```xml
<rss>
  <channel>
    <item>
      <!-- Individual article details -->
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

The `<item>` tag describes one individual article in your blog. One or more
`<item>`s make up a `<channel>`. It’s valid to have an empty `<channel>`, but
not terribly interesting!

That’s all the framework to get things set up. Let’s actually, you know, give
out some information.

Both `<channel>` and `<item>` **require** the following three tags:

```xml
<title>The name of the thing</title>
<link>The location of the thing</link>
<description>A summary of the thing</description>
```

You must provide these three tags for your `<channel>`, and for each `<item>`.
Fortunately, they’re easy to find: all articles have a title, as does your
website (`<title>` is one of the few attributes required by HTML5 to exist on
every page); all web pages have a link location, and the description is just
a short blurb that your blog engine probably encourages you to write.

For me, all this information is bundled in each article by Middleman, and I can
just pull it out with Ruby, which makes generating `<item>` groups for each
article on here *very* easy[^3].

## Extra Information

That’s the bare minimum to make a working RSS file. But you probably have more
information about your blog and your articles, and the RSS format will happily
take it!

Here’s what my `feed.rss` looks like (the required stuff is stripped because we
already covered it):

```xml
<rss xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
  <channel>
    <atom:link
      href="https://myrrlyn.net/feed.rss"
      rel="self"
      type="application/rss+xml" />
    <category>Programming</category>
    <copyright>2016-present myrrlyn (Alexander Payne)</copyright>
    <generator>Middleman (Ruby)</generator>
    <language>en-us</language>
    <lastBuildDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 03:35:42 -0000</lastBuildDate>

    <item>
      <guid>same as link</guid>
      <author>me@example.com (Alexander Payne)</author>
      <pubDate>The date attached to the article</pubDate>
      <category>The tag attached to the article</category>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

The `xmlns:atom` attribute in `<rss>`, and the `<atom:link>` element, allow this
RSS file to be digested by an Atom reader, which is a similar standard that
fizzled out when RSS did. It’s a nice thing to have, and just lets some more
clients read this file.

The `<category>` tag describe what kind of content is in your channel, and in
each individual item. I just copy the tags that show up in the nav section to
the right (desktop viewers) or the bottom (phone viewers) into the
`<item> <category>` elements (you can have more than one `<category>` per
`<item>`) and call it good.

The `<copyright>` tag is just what it says. Doesn’t need to be anything fancy,
or even present, but it’s always worthwhile in this environment.

The `<genorator>` tag says what software made the RSS file.

The `<language>` tag says in which human language the content is written. It
should be one of the standard language-region shortcodes. Because I write in
English from the United States, mine is `en-us`.

The `<lastBuildDate>` tag is the date (in RFC 822 format, which is bad and wrong
but whatever) of the last time the RSS file was generated. I use `DateTime.now`
which turns into the moment of compilation when compiling.

The `<guid>` tag is just a `<link>` that really means it. Websites can have more
than one path to content, and the commonly distributed path might change to have
new things, so the `<guid>` goes specifically to that text. If this post is
informative to you, then you probably have a system where `<link>` and `<guid>`
are identical.

The `<author>` tag must be an email, followed by a parenthetical name, the exact
opposite of the way Git wants a name followed by a bracketed email. Who needs
single standards, am I right?

The `<pubDate>` tag is the date when the specific item was published.

These are all optional, but provide more context about what you’re serving, and
are all probably information you have handy for your whole blog and for each
article, so why not include them?

# Generation

I will provide code that is specific to my environment: Ruby language, Middleman
framework. This will not be directly applicable to you unless you also use this,
but it should give you a good starting point for writing your own.

Middleman supports using Embedded Ruby, and will execute the Ruby code placed
inside other text files for text manipulation.

Here are the interesting parts my actual `feed.rss.erb`, which gets compiled
down to just `feed.rss`:

```erb
<rss>
  <channel>
    <lastBuildDate><%= DateTime.now.utc.rfc822 %></lastBuildDate>

    <% sitemap.resources %>
    <% .select { |r| r.is_a? Middleman::Blog::BlogArticle } %>
    <% .select { |b| b.path.start_with? "blog" } %>
    <% .sort { |a, b| a.date <=> b.date }.reverse %>
    <% .each do |article| %>
    <item>
      <title><%= article.title %></title>
      <link>https://myrrlyn.net/<%= article.destination_path %></link>
      <guid><!-- same --></guid>
      <description><%= article.data["summary"] %></description>
      <pubDate><%= article.date.utc.rfc822 %></pubDate>
      <% article.data["tags"].each do |tag| %>
      <category><%= tag %></category>
      <% end %>
    </item>
    <% end %>
  </channel>
</rss>
```

Let me walk through this mess of nonsense. For the record, *none* of this was
documented in Middleman, and I had to open up my app in a Ruby console and just
blindly wander around in the guts of it until I figured it out piece by little
piece. I don’t want to do that again, thus, this post.

The first thing that happens in that Middleman records the current time and
sticks that in `<lastBuildDate>`.

Then, Middleman looks up the global `sitemap` object, which holds the entire
context of my website, and queries its `resources` member, which is everything
in my source folder. This includes all the CSS and JavaScript and images and
other pages, and I don’t want any of that.

This is where Middleman’s second-class blog engine hurts me. When the blog
extension is active, I have access to my entire blog as a Ruby object, so I can
manipulate the blog HTML templates nicely. But it is not active during the
compilation of this RSS file, so I have to fake it.

```ruby
.select { |r| r.is_a? Middleman::Blog::BlogArticle }
```

uses the fact that, since the blog engine was actively running when loading all
my text, and is still around but dormant now, to find only the resource objects
that are articles in a blog. This ignores all the other stuff I listed earlier.

```ruby
.select { |b| b.path.start_with? "blog" }
```

I have two Middleman blogs on this website. The other one is my *Elder Scrolls*
fanfiction, and is not part of this file (I have an identical file just for
those). So I only keep the blog articles that have a `blog/...` path.

I then organize them by date, and reverse the list, so the newest is first and
the oldest is last. Once done, I begin iterating through each of them.

The text in between `.each do |article|` and `end` gets duplicated for each
`article` in the pared-down and sorted collection, so each blog post gets an
`<item>` stack. In that stack, I have access to the `article` variable and all
its associated data. I can query my frontmatter with `data[...]` and get
information directly with `.title` and `.date`, and that’s how all the parts
get filled in.

Once this is done, I have a completely built RSS XML file, ready to deploy!

# Discovery

Just having a text file on your server that has RSS content in it isn’t enough.
There’s no canonical filename (I used `feed.rss` so `nginx` would know to serve
it with the right MIME type, but it could also be `rss.xml` or anything you
want, really) so browsers and RSS readers don’t know how to find it like they do
`index.html` and `favicon.ico`.

In the `<head>` section of my HTML templates, I inserted a new `<link>` element:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link
      rel="alternate"
      href="//myrrlyn.net/blog/feed.rss"
      type="application/rss+xml"
      title="Unsolicited Discourse"
    />
  </head>
</html>
```

This `<link>` *is* a universally-recognized element, so your web browser will
see it and (at least on desktop) light up the RSS feed icon and let you
subscribe to it. This link, `//myrrlyn.net/blog/feed.rss`, is also the path you
would put into a feed reader app in order to get notifications every time I
publish something.

On your site, you would change it to be the URL of your RSS file. It can live
anywhere (I also have a copy of my main blog’s RSS at `//myrrlyn.net/feed.rss`
and my TES work at `//myrrlyn.net/oeuvre/feed.rss`), as long as your HTML pages
know where it is.

# Conclusion

It took me a while to get here, but now I have a free, neutral, personal means
of advertising my work to people who are interested to match my free, neutral,
personal means of hosting it at all. RSS feeds are a philosophically important
alternative to Twitter feeds and reddit aggregations and Facebook timelines,
just as personal websites are philosophically important alternatives to profiles
on those same services.

It’s harder to set up a website and get it seen and distributed than it is to
set up a social-media profile and write posts there, but in my opinion it’s well
worth the effort.

And you can always post your own links in your social media. I certainly do and
will.

[^1]: Wherever possible, use anyone else but them. They’re a bad business and a
    scam, and the Mozilla docs are better for everything webdev related. Except
    W3S has better discoverability for their RSS docs than MDN does, so I found
    them first. Oh well.

[^2]: The W3S documentation is not at all comprehensive, and it wasn’t until I
    tried validating my manifests against a compliant service that I found a
    whole lot of errors about which W3S did not bother to inform me. But it got
    me to a point where I had something to validate, at least.
