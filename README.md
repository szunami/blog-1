This is a collection of essays, monologues, and observations that makes up my
idea of a blog.

I am licensing the texts in this repository as CC-BY-NC-ND. Unlike my software
projects, which are permissively MIT licensed, or my TES writings, for which I
can’t really claim copyright anyway, I feel very strongly that this project is
*my* work. Obviously I’m fine with it being viewed freely, but I would rather
not have statements wind up taken out of context.

I will gladly waive the restrictions on modification or commercial distribution
if I am ever to be quoted or referenced and that becomes necessary; just contact
me first. My email is on my website.
