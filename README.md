# Insufficiently Magical

This is a collection of essays, monologues, and observations that makes up my
idea of a blog. I am not committing to a topic or schedule at this time.

## Rendering

The contents of this blog are written in an extended Markdown dialect. They
require a parser that can detect and handle YAML frontmatter, and they use the
Inline Attribute Syntax list found in the Kramdown and Earmark libraries. While
they will render acceptably under most Markdown parsers, I write solely and
specifically to target the Markdown and HTML engines running on my website.

## Licensing

I am licensing the texts in this repository as CC-BY-NC-ND. Unlike my software
projects, which are permissively MIT licensed, or my TES writings, for which I
can’t really claim copyright anyway, I feel very strongly that this project is
*my* work. Obviously I’m fine with it being viewed freely, but I would rather
not have statements wind up taken out of context.

You can share direct links, or use embedding that retains clear attribution; if
you wish to copy any of my text into your own writing directly, contact me.
