I’m a big believer in web programming. My very first creative endeauvours with
the computer were making very bad HTML pages in Microsoft Office® FrontPage™️
in elementary school. While I attempted to take Java™️ and C++ courses in high
school, I didn’t really start programming until late 2013, when I learned [Sass]
to write the stylsheet for a subreddit I liked.

Web programming is cool because the best way to convince a person that they’re
doing useful work is to show them something, then have them do stuff and watch
it change in response to their actions. Command-line programs just don’t have
the same level of engagement, and desktop graphical programming has a lot more
boilerplate and required components. But to make a website, you can just write
some stuff down in a file, drag it into Firefox™️, and see it live.

So I’ve always liked making websites, and ever since I started programming in
earnest I’ve always wanted to build my own as much as possible rather than just
toss some documents onto a host somebody else controls and let them control the
formatting.

## My First Website

I started out by cobbling together a single-page application from some HTML
partials and JavaScript. I actually got pretty far into having a functional,
though by no means flawless, single-page site that could serve a handful of
pages and weird resources. This was 2014, so at the time, I pretty much just
used it for my *Elder Scrolls* fanfiction. I still have the source code on a
temporarily-dead machine and hopefully I’ll be able to resurrect it. Most of its
content is superseded but there were two projects in particular that I want
back.

## My Second Website

After I got out of university, I had a bunch of free time on my hands, what with
being a household boyfriend and unemployed, so I built a new website out of the
[Ruby] language [Middleman] framework. It was a nice experience to start, and I
liked the fact that it let me use different layouts for different regions of my
site, which I was not able to easily do in other competitors. I wanted to
continue hosting my *Elder Scrolls* fanfic on a subsection
