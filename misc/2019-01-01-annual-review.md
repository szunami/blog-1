  A review of my 2018, and hopes and goals for 2019.

2018 was a bad year. I think we all agree on that, though all of us for
different reasons.

## Workplace Shenanigans

I started the year without an assignment at work, because my satellite had been
declared dead shortly before winter break 2017. I got put on a new assignment,
and stumbled immediately. Later this year I would be added to another project,
where I would again stumble on my first task, making me 3/3 on poor first
impressions.

In April, I made my first trip to Albuquerque of the year. I had hoped it would
be my last. If you’ve followed along with my life at all, you know it was not.
I started traveling regularly in May. I was about 50/50 in Albuquerque and
Logan. I went down for all of May, then went back and forth in June. Two weeks
in July, one week home, one week at Scout camp, one week in Logan, one week in
Yellowstone and RustConf, then immediately back to Albuquerque for seven weeks.
Back to Logan for a few weeks, back to Albuquerque for two weeks, back to Logan.
Then I packed up my apartment and moved.

Seven months of destabilized life, eternally oscillating between hotels and an
empty apartment, is not good for you. I stopped making food, because I never
knew where I’d be. I stopped working out, because I didn’t have the energy in
either town. I gained *fifty* pounds – I had been 145lb before the trip, and I
broke 190lb before I realized I was in trouble. My work suffered. My personal
quality of life and my friendships suffered. My mental health took a beating.

## Daddy Issues

I will tell the full story of this next paragraph in a different post. The
summary is that, a week before my 25<sup>th</sup> birthday, my mom called me to
inform me that dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. In my *[AHCA]* article, I
wrote about the first two cancer diagnoses. I did not write about the specter
that has haunted us since 2007. This specter.

Dad had surgery, had chemotherapy and radiation. He had had surgery twice
before, chemotherapy once before, and had never had radiation.

I saw my dad in September, October, November, and December. I remember he called
me in August, feeling strongly that the surgery had gotten it all, that he had
ten to fifteen years left. He knew this would kill him. He thought he had beaten
it once, and could hold the line for some time to come. He was wrong.

In September, he could walk, he could talk. He was weakened by the radiation but
otherwise pretty okay. He was missing some of his left visual field, but was
still a person.

In October, I had to help lift him out of bed and chairs. While I was at
Rust Belt Rust, he attempted to jog, tripped, and hit his head on the road. I
went from the conference to the hospital.

In November, he was using a walker.

In December, he wasn’t walking.

I will write about this afterwards. Suffice to say, this has destroyed my mom’s
life, and has really done a number on mine. I feel profoundly guilty that my
instability at work had prevented me from coming home. I should’ve been working
at home since October. I should’ve moved in September, but that didn’t pan out.
By the time I moved in December, the worst was over, the worst was yet to come.
Mom still needs me at home but in a different way and for different reasons.
I am leaving shortly after I publish this post.

I really, really, need to book a therapist.

## Bad at Friendship

I’ve been a pretty subpar friend this year to everyone who matters to me. I
would like to blame it on the travel and the cancer, and I plan to lean hard on
those, but those are influences, not excuses. I need to get back in shape at
being better supportive, at not being single-mindedly driven to push my
worldview on people, to treat my friends as equals.

I struggle a lot with letting people be vulnerable on their own, in ways with
which they are comfortable or want to be uncomfortable. A cheap example of this
is my insistence on buying things, like drinks, or brunch, even though I have
the lowest salary of my friend group. I struggle to get out from behind the
wheel, even when I’m tired. My friends are my equals, not my Scouts; I need to
be better at treating them as such.

## Personal Unhealth

I didn’t properly exercise at all last year. May onwards is easy to excuse, but
I dropped the ball all by myself in the front half of the year. And I’m paying
for it.

I’m 25 now; I can’t rely on youthful vigor and my burn-hot metabolism to do the
work for me. I’ve joked since I was a teen that I was in good shape on borrowed
time; that I would turn 25 and my metabolism would shut off and all my bad
habits would come calling. The best time to get ahead of this was last year; the
second best time is now.

My best friend told me with all the love in her heart that I was a wreck and
that I needed to get therapy, on February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2018. I told her I
would, and then I didn’t, and then I couldn’t. I *need* to do that. I have all
the problems I did last year, and now more.

I’ve avoided mental health my entire life because my dad reinforced in me that
if I had a mental health record, I would be unfit for military or civil service.
I turned out to be unfit for military anyway, because I’m color-deficient, and
then because my personal beliefs and goals changed. But I’m on track for my
clearance, and if I have hurdles they’ll be for different reasons, and my
brother says times have changed.

I’m not going to talk about my specific problems on this *extremely public blog*
but I’m aware of them, and I’m aware I need to fix them, and that requires a
professional.

I also need to get a physical, and my teeth cleaned, and get glasses. I didn’t
do any of that last year, and my teeth are fine but unlike my abs, degradation
is a one way street. Can’t let anything happen there. And I’m tired of my vision
being *just* off enough that it’s perfect if I squint a little. That’s bad for
my skin.

## Intellectual Languor

I didn’t read enough; I didn’t make nearly as much progress on Cosmonaut as I
wanted. I need to work on expanding my reading list, and on branching out beyond
technical and genre lit.

## Some Good Things, Please

I gave a hell of a best-man speech for my best friend Kyle. Improvised the day
of, no notes, spoken off the dome. Kyle cried, his wife cried, his dad cried,
my college buddies were surprised I was capable of human emotion, it was good.

I gave my first talk at Rust Belt Rust. Improvised the day of, few notes, spoken
off the dome. The audience laughed, they clapped, my brother told me I need to
say “uh” less, it was good.

> I should probably learn to write speeches, huh.

I am the sole developer and maintainer of the project that made me move to
Albuquerque. This is technically bad, because the “bus” in “bus factor” **is**
hitting me, but it feels good to be The One With The Domain Knowledge.

I learned a *lot* about Rust, and my main work this year, [`bitvec`], saw real
progress. Over break, I completely rewrote its internals in order to be able to
support fully generalized behavior, and it is now much more powerful than it was
in the first draft. I plan to cut a `1.0` release soon.

I will brag about `bitvec` in its own post, but it is the most powerful and
capable bit-vector library in the Rust ecosystem, and I intend to start
promoting the hell out of it once I hit `1.0`.

I am renting an actual house, now! Not an apartment! I refused to buy a house,
because I want *out* of Albuquerque in three years (I’d apologize to Sean
Griffin here if I thought he read this).

## Okay But Now What

Here is a short list of habits and goals I want to actively build this year

- ｔｈｅｒａｐｙ
- get a gym membership, now that I can’t use my university’s gym because I’m far
  away
  - stabilize my weight at 175lb, break 100lb weights on my upper body
  - stabilize my mile time below six minutes
- get glasses
  - don’t lose said glasses
- find a Scout troop again, or some other way to go camping and do stuff
- read at least one non-fiction, non-technical book a month
- write `bitvec`’s book and finish it
- scatter Dad’s ashes with my brother
- crush it at the house-haver game. I’m so tasteless at decor but I’ve got great
  people on whom to lean.
- cultivate my existing friendships and pay down my social debt from 2018
- resume learning German

Other than the first two, these are all second-order effects that should follow
from just taking better maintenance of myself as a person, in all regards. I’ve
let myself slip, and that’s hurt a lot. I can get back in shape, I can work on
my mental health, and that will do much more for me than any list of individual
entries. But those are some of the main demonstrable milestones I want to hit as
a way of measuring improvement.
