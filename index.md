# Insufficient Magic

When I made this website, I had planned to write a lot more long-form text a lot
more often. Unfortunately, it’s self-hosted, which is to say, more often broken
than working, so most of my writing is on Twitter.

This is a mixture of my personal diary, my idle musings, my technical notes, and
occasionally some things actually written for an audience. I make no promises as
to consistency of topic, relevance, theme, or sanity. I do, however, promise
that everything published here will be interminably long and of insufferable
grammatical construction.

## Writing Style

I will use marked call-out boxes, with colored backgrounds and frequently an
icon, to indicate information that is related to the main text but is not part
of the primary narrative. These are themed after industrial safety/hazard
signage standards, and have vaguely similar goals.

> Blue boxes like this are essentially long-form parentheticals; a sidebar I
> thought was interesting or worth putting out as an assumed question by the
> reader, but skippable by people more familiar with the topic about which I’m
> writing.

Alright, that’s quite enough instructions on *how* to read. Here’s a grouped
list of *what* to read!
