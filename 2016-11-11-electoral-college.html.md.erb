# Foreword

The way the U.S. national election process works is the subject of a fair amount
of criticism. I’m a critic of it myself, but many of the complaints I’ve seen
levied – especially since Election Day – are, in my opinion, actually harmful to
the successful operation of American political structure.

For whom I did or didn’t vote is irrelevant, and frankly nobody’s concern. The
election was determined before my state was even *counted*, so we’ve already
established that my vote was effectively worthless. That’s not a nice sentiment,
considering one of the things we teach our citizens is that everyone has a vote
and everyone’s vote matters, but, there are 350 million US citizens. It’s pretty
difficult to have any individual voice stand out.

# Electoral College History

“Ms. Clinton won the popular vote!” people declaim. “This is a democracy and
therefore she should be president!”

Well, no. The US **isn’t** a democracy. It’s a representative republic, and it
started out as a federation but that turned out to be impractical in global
politics at the time. It also would be impractical now, if the EU’s troubles are
any gauge.

If you’ll hearken back to high school civics class, you may remember some
discussions about how the legislative branch of the government (that’s Congress)
would be put together. Of the original thirteen states-née-colonies,
there was a fair amount of size and power disparity.

Virginia was very large and populous, and proposed a population-based
representation. Edmund Randolph argued that since Virginia had a large
population and many citizens, Virginia should have more of a say in the national
government. After all, the nation’s decisions would have a very large absolute
effect on Virginians.

New Jersey was very small and unpopulated, and proposed a state-based
representation. William Paterson argued that the large and populous states (like
Virginia), would simply steamroll the small states and disregard their interests
when convenient. If this was truly to be a union of equal states, all states
should be able to partake in the government.

Connecticut, like the girl in that cereal commercial, stepped up and said “why
not both?” Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth drafted a compromise that would
allocate one house of the legislature by population count, satisfying Virginia,
and allocate the other equally among all states, satisfying New Jersey.

This turned out to be a good plan, because it allows for representation of each
citizen in the House and representation of each region in the Senate. America is
big on personal liberty, sovereignty, and equality, but equally important if
less obvious is the concept of collective liberty, sovereignty, and equality. To
say that each person is of equal importance is to say that small groups are
worth less than large groups; to say that each group is of equal importance
diminishes the value of individuals in large groups. A mixed Congress must
therefore balance the wishes of both.

The Electoral College is, ideally, the application of the Connecticut compromise
to the Executive branch. I cannot stress this enough – America is not now and
has never been a classical democracy.

Under a more democratic structure (Virginia plan), the populous regions would
outweigh the sparse regions. Large groups could throw their weight around, and
small groups have little defense. This was not good in the early days of the
country and is even less good now, for reasons I’ll explore later.

Under a more republican structure (New Jersey plan), the will of the people
would be drastically inflated or curtailed based on where they happened to live.
This is also not a good thing, since it makes a tyranny of the minority rather
easy to accomplish.

The Connecticut Compromise theory mixes both of these. The Electoral College (in
theory) is largely beholden to the will of the people and satisfies democracy,
but allows for adjustments so that small states are not completely drowned out
and satisfies federation and the republic.

# Modern Relevance

How does this apply to the modern era? Let’s look at population distribution.
For this table, the U.S. population is estimated to be almost 325 million.

<% table_cities do |row| %>
<%= row %>
<% end %>

Thirty-nine metropolitan regions comprise a majority of the population. Under
first-past-the-post voting rules, those 39 cities can control the course for the
entire nation. This is pure democracy in action, and it’s not a good thing. This
is what the small states feared from the Virginia plan, and they’re right to do
so.

Ultimately, roughly 75% of the American population lives in urban regions
comprising 3% of the total land area. Even setting aside partisan allegiances in
the cities, this *clearly* shows that pure democracy would result in national
policy favoring the urban population, and silencing the rural population. That’s
pure tyranny of the majority, and it’s something the New Jersey plan feared and
something the rural citizens still fear today.

The Senate, with two senators per state regardless of population, permits the
rural and sparsely-populated states to still have a say in federal legislation.
Similarly, the Electoral College, which gives each state one elector per
congressman (senators and representatives), gives the rural states with low
population more of a voice in the presidential election.

## Republic or Democracy?

This is the fifth election in U.S. history in which the Electoral College has
had a different result from the popular vote.

Considering the system is designed to stymie tyranny of the majority while still
allowing a largely democratic process, occasionally the minority has to win.

The system is working as it should be, more or less, it’s just that this was a
singularly unpopular time for a minority win to crop up.

Also, considering the razor-thin margin between the two leading candidates,
neither of whom possess a national majority (at time of writing, Mrs. Clinton
has 47.79% of the national vote and Mr. Trump has 47.30%), there are much more
pressing problems than a popularity inversion.

## Unfair Voting Power Distribution

It’s easy to claim the Electoral College is flawed, which it is, but not due to
the allocation of electors. People claim that it is unfair because if you take
the two extreme ends (California, pop. 39.14 million, 55 electors and Wyoming,
pop. 586,107, 3 electors) and do the requisite math, California has 711 thousand
citizens per elector while Wyoming has 195 thousand citizens per elector. As
such, the claim is that democracy is violated because Wyoming votes for the
presidency are more than three times more powerful than California votes for the
presidency.

On the other hand, urban voters are much more likely to vote in blocs, whereas
rural voters are not. Furthermore, the population disparity is so massive that
even giving Wyoming voters three votes while California voters have only one,
California will still thrash Wyoming in a general election.

Take this cartogram, for example, which shows the states’ electoral clout as
area. (Cartogram source: Washington Post)

![](<%= File.join dir, "cartogram.jpg" %>)

So, it’s un-democratic to say that Wyoming voters are thrice as important as
California voters, but isn’t it also un-republican to say that the San Francisco
urban area carries the same electoral weight as the entire *state* of Wyoming?

(Incidentally, Mrs. Clinton’s lead margin, 630,877, is slightly larger than the
population of Vermont, second-from-last thanks to Wyoming.)

The Electoral College being a winner-take-all system for all but two states,
however, *is* a huge flaw. It effectively silences half of the population in
each state. For instance, rural California counties usually vote Republican, yet
the urban cores make it utterly pointless for rural California citizens to vote
at all, since they can’t possibly outweigh the cities, and the cities habitually
vote Democrat.

### Absurd Math

Let’s look at three examples *ad absurdum* of the current Electoral College
implementation. The first will concentrate on winning the fewest states, and the
second on the fewest people. Each will result in 270 electoral votes, and a
national victory, without coming *remotely* close to a representative vote. The
third will show a massively popular favorite losting the race.

1. Half of the electoral votes are found in the eleven most populated states:
California, Texas, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia,
Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, Virginia. Since the College is
Winner-Take-All for all these states, only half-plus-one of the population need
be courted. This comes out to be **<%= minority_win[0][0] %>**, or
<%= minority_win[0][1]%>.

2. Starting from the lowest population states (whose citizens have the highest
electoral clout per capita) and working up, a candidate must win the bottom 41
(D.C. included) in order to clear 270. This comes out to be
**<%= minority_win[1][0] %>**, or <%= minority_win[1][1] %>.

3. A candidate who takes the inverse of scenario 2, collecting 100% of the top
10 states’ votes for 256 electors, 100% of Washington state for another 12
electors, and half-minus-one of the other thirty-nine states plus D.C., will
fail to satisfy the electoral college even with **<%= majority_loss[0] %>**
votes (<%= majority_loss[1] %>).

The Electoral College is implemented to defray the potential of a tyranny of the
majority, but its implementation by the states (Maine and Nebraska are the only
two which do not use winner-take-all) makes it susceptible to tyranny of the
minority instead. This is the fifth election in which the popular vote has
disagreed with the electoral vote – not by much, but enough that people are
complaining.

# Solutions

There are a few solutions available. The simplest and, in my opinion, most
obvious choice is to take the Electoral College, which is already allocated like
Congress, and make it represent like Congress as well. Another would be to
change how votes are tallied in the first place, before Electors come into play
at all.

## Granularity of Electors

Given that laws governing allocation of Congressional districts already state
that all districts in a state must have rougly the same amount of population,
allocating electors to track Congressional representatives (all but two vote by
the district results, and the last two vote according to state decision) would
be much more fair to all voters, and likely result in Electoral College votes
more closely mirroring reality. Congressional districts are already susceptible
to gerrymandering, but that’s another issue entirely.

Unfortunately for those decrying the Electoral College this time around, chances
are that it *still* wouldn’t exactly mirror the popular vote, and Mr. Trump
would still win. After all, the two Senate-representing Electors vote would vote
with their state’s popular majority, and we’ve seen how that turned out.

I’d do the math for this scenario, except I can’t find a readily-accessible list
of election results by county and I certainly have no intention of manually
compiling one at this time.

## Other Voting Systems

I trust by now I’ve made it clear that winner-takes-all scorekeeping is hugely
troublesome. It doesn’t represent the actual will of the voters, and it
naturally tends towards a two-party system. As we’ve seen in every election with
even remotely strong third-party candidates, they wind up taking votes away from
the candidate closer to them and thus inadvertently strengthening the candidate
less like them. For instance, in 2016, Mr. Johnson stole votes from Mr. Trump,
not from Mrs. Clinton, and Mrs. Stein stole votes from Mrs. Clinton, not from
Mr. Trump.

As it stands, there is no positive incentive, and a strong negative incentive,
for voting for third-party candidates who may more accurately reflect one’s
views. In a presidential race, where the field must ultimately be narrowed to
one individual, there’s not much room for change. However, a system such as
Single Transferrable Vote, combined with a more granular Electoral College,
could make a difference.

In STV, each voter still only has one vote, but rather than having their vote
be discarded when their chosen candidate is eliminated, their vote automatically
transfers to another.

Imagine a centrist, independent voter who feels the exact opposite way from
popular American opinions. They feel most in favor with Mrs. Stein, and feel
that if she is an unviable candidate, they would rather go with Mr. Johnson,
with whom they disagree but at least respect that he’s another third-party
candidate. Barring those two, they lastly would pick Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump
and have no intention of voting for him whatsoever.

This voter would mark their ballot for Mrs. Stein as first favor, Mr. Johnson as
second, Mrs. Clinton as third, and leave Mr. Trump’s slot empty.

The counters for their Congressional district would, upon determining that Mrs.
Stein is hopelessly outnumbered, go through the list of Stein voters and recount
for their second choice. In this instance, Mr. Johnson now collects this
particular vote from Mrs. Stein, who no longer needs it.

Imagine that Mr. Johnson did not have enough votes initially to be a viable
candidate in the district, but after Mrs. Stein’s elimination, collected enough
votes from her former voters that he passed the majority. Now, rather than
wholly discarding the votes of everyone who voted for either third-party
candidate, they have become viable.

This is, admittedly, an unlikely situation in the current climate, and more
realistically Mr. Johnson also is disqualified. The counters now go through and
take all of Mr. Johnson’s votes, whether first or second choice, and adjust
those ballots again. Some votes go to Mrs. Clinton, and some to Mr. Trump, and
most importantly, the penalty of voting third-party is reduced from having one’s
ballot effectively shredded, to merely getting a candidate one supports somewhat
less.

Imagine a right-leaning voter. Without third-party candidates, they would vote
for Mr. Trump. With third-party candidates, they vote for one of them. The
presence of third-party candidates thus takes a vote away from Mr. Trump, and
will never return it even when those candidates are eliminated. Thus, it is in
the interest of the major parties to ensure that there is not a third-party
candidate who is ideologically close to them, but it is *very much* in the
parties’ interests to support a third-party candidate ideologically close to
their opponent.

If your political system favors false-flag operations to support your opponents’
candidates in hopes of ensuring your own victory due to infighting, do you think
*maybe your political system is broken*?

# Look to the Future

What can we do about this?

The national Constitution mandates only that the Electoral College exist, and
be allocated numbers according to each state’s Congressional representation.
The fact that Electors are 96% of the time assigned as winner-takes-all is the
fault of the states and the major parties.

Start petitions to adopt a district-based Elector system, with the two remaining
Electors going as the state wishes, either popular or by district count,
depending on how democratic or republican the lawmakers are feeling.

Start petitions to change how your district, or state, tallies votes. STV is
able to be implemented within a legal framework expecting FPTP, since it is just
a few recounts before declaring a majority winner by virtue of repeatedly
eliminating the least-popular candidate.

Remember your civics classes, though. The U.S. is **not** a democracy, and we
definitely do not want it to become one, because tyranny of the majority is a
very real thing, especially with increasing polarization of society and culture
between urban and rural populations. The Electoral College shouldn’t be
abolished, but it should definitely be overhauled.

Let’s make American politics great. Not great again, because we have no glory
days of well-executed voting systems on which to look back. Let’s change that.
