  I wrote a Rust crate that teaches data structures how to flip the endianness
  of their component members.
---

I went to [RustConf][1] this year, and decided that would be a good opportunity
to learn some new features of Rust and make something that could tackle a
problem I faced at work. Since both of my major projects at work involve
handling structured data that traverses a network, I thought a useful project
would be a crate that allows structs to convert their interior representations
between endian orders.

Endianness refers to the ordering of bits or bytes in a multiple-bit or
multiple-byte unit. This is an important part of processor design and network
protocol signaling, but is generally transparent to any higher concern.
Nobody above networking hardware design knows or cares about bit-level
endianness, for instance, and byte-level endianness *should* not be a concern of
anyone above a networking driver. As I am writing network drivers that involve
communicating data between machines with different byte endianness, such a crate
is useful to me.
