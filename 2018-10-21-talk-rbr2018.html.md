  I accidentally gave a lightning talk at Rust Belt Rust 2018.

I went to Rust Belt Rust 2018 thinking I’d just hang out with [a][0] [couple][1]
[friends][2] and see some fun talks and chat about Rust. Maybe hang out with my
parents a bit, since they live an hour from the venue.

There was a poster with sticky notes lying next to it, titled “Lightning Talks”
and, seized by a brief flurry of whimsy and mania, I wrote
`for Rust in Space { myrrlyn }` on one and put it up.

The next day, it was the most popular talk on the board, and that’s when I
began to panic. I’d never given a talk before! I work in areas where several
details are state secrets! I didn’t have *slides*!

So, Saturday morning before talks started, I gathered my scattered wits, and
sat down with Arshia so each of us could work on our slides for our talks later
that afternoon.

Talks are like diamonds – made with blood, over-valued, and best formed under
intense pressue.

Here are my slides:

- [ODP][3]
- [PDF][4]

And here is the talk:

- [Talk Recording][5]

Apologies for the constant “uhhhhh”; I was forming the sentences about half a
second ahead of actually saying them, and the time pressure is real.
